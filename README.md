<h1>Black Jack Exercise</h1>
A PHP exercise to practice PHP coding whilst studying at iO Academy
<h2>The Exercise</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Create a PHP program that runs the simplified blackjack game</li>
  <li>From a single deck of cards each player is given 2 cards.</li>
  <li>Cards 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 have 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 points respectively. J, Q, K are all worth 10 points. A is worth 11 points</li>
  <li>Each player has a score which is the sum of the points for their two cards the winner is the player with the highest points</li>
  <li>If either player goes over 21, the other player wins.</li>
  <li>If the scores are equal or both over 21 it should output a draw</li>
</ol>
<h4>Stretch goals</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Output the cards both players picked</li>
  <li>If either players score is < 14, draw a third card</li>
  <li>If an ace is picked, and the total score is over 21, the ace becomes worth 1 point</li>
</ol>

<h2>The Process</h2>
I wrote the code initially in a procedural way (within index.php file), before changing to OOP.

<h2>Future Development</h2>
I'd like to try and expand beyond the exercise so that it works most closely to a 'real' blackjack game, so a number of players can play against the 'house'.
